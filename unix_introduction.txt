ls -l = ls lists all directories in the folder while -l is an argument that makes ls use a "long list" format.
	with -l, the folders creation date is shown, files extensions and also the permission of the files.
	
	example: -rwxr-xr--
	The first three characters (excluding the first) is the owner. rwx means that the owner can read, write and execute the files.
	The next three characters are the permissions of the group which the file belongs. r-x means read and execute.
	The next three characters are the permissions of everybody else. r-- means that everybody can read the file, but nothing else.
	
	To change the permission, write the command terminal:
	chmod 755 <file_name.extension>
	755 means 7 for owner, 5 for group and 5 for everybody else. The numbers correspond to different permissions.
